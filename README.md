# Machine Learning Regression: House Prices

This is a [Kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) I made to practice regression problems. My final position was 3343 out of 4570, which means I have a lot of room for improvement but I believe it isnt that bad for my first Kaggle competition. 

In the future I will do some feature engineering and selection on the categorical features, which I didnt pay enough attention to, and use the gradient boosting regressor method instead of random forests, as I believe is more appropiate for this type of regression problems.

**Update v.1:**

Gradient boosting improved my score from 0.17 to 0.145 which is a significant improvement, going from the percentile 70th to the percentile 50th (mean).
